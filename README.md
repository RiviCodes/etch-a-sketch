# Etch-A-Sketch

[Live on GitHub Pages](https://rivicodes.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

_This project's objective is to simulate the behaviour of an Etch-A-Sketch, using the cursor/mouse to draw in the (simulated) screen._

_The 'CLEAR' button at the top of the screen has two purposes:_

/*:
_1. Asks the user to input a number. A new grid will be created based on that criteria._
_2. The previous grid will be cleared and replaced with the new one._
*/

_Due to possible perfomance issues if the number is too high, users can only input a grid size less-than and/or equal-to 100. Attemps to use a higher number will just stop the function from running._
